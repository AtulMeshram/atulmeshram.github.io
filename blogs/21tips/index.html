									<h3>Start by preparing specifically for the companies you are sitting for</h3>
									<p>Some of the Analytics companies are going to focus more on maths, puzzles and your resourcefulness than your knowledge of core subjects. While some Software companies  will require a good knowledge of OOPs especially Java, C++ or C#.  Almost all coding profiles though will test in depth your algorithm writing skills.</p>

									<h3>Check the Glassdoor reviews about the interview process of the companies</h3>
									<p>Most of them paint an accurate picture about what you are going to face. Read about the interview process of other candidates and try to gain some insights into which subjects the interviewers of that particular company most focus on.</p>

									<h3>Google for past placement papers of the company you will be sitting for next</h3>
									<p>It seems unimportant but let me tell you a secret. Most of the companies have a standard set of questions which they repeat throughout the whole Placement session wherever they go. I am not saying mug the standard answers. I am just saying get a general idea about the type of questions that they ask.</p>

									<h3>Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Networking and DBMS are the subjects most interviewers focus on</h3>
									<p>Now that you have a rough idea about the whole thing it is time to focus on individual subjects. For DSA if possible read the Cormen book(Standard reference book on Data Structures and Algorithms for most good colleges in India). As one of my friend said ‘its the biggest investment you are going to make in our college time and which will yield more returns for you than any other thing you do during college’. Try to perfect all your core subjects but focus on Data Structures and Algorithms most apart from Operating Systems. You can even buy 'Crack the Coding Interview' or follow 'Geeks For Geeks' website. It is generally used by most students as a source for good programming questions.</p>

									<h3>Call a few seniors and collect their experience </h3>
									<p>When you are done with all the previous points and you still have got time, it is never late to call a few seniors( who are working at the company you are trying to get into) and ask about their own experiences. If you have a good network of friends it wont be hard to find a senior who may guide you.</p>

									<h3>Do not blatantly lie</h3>
									<p>These guys were themselves students earlier and have been part of the interview process all throughout their life. Questions like “Why do you have this much CG?” ” Why do you want to work for our company?” “Where do you want to see yourself in 5 years”  are commonplace and it would help you a great deal if you are prepared for these beforehand. Do try to not mumble/bluff through your technical rounds too. If you are confident then answer. Otherwise ask politely in terms of ” I am not exactly sure of the answer but can I tell what I know about the topic” and try to make an educated guess if you are permitted.</p>

									<h3>Read the "About Us" page on the company website</h3>
									<p>Listen carefully during the company presentations generally held before the Interview process. When you are given the opportunity to ask questions do not hesitate and show how much you are already familiar with the company and your job profile. Good questions to ask will be about a typical day at the job, about the interviewer’s job profile, what qualities they look for in a prospective employee or something unique you noticed during the presentation.</p>

									<h3>Do not get demotivated</h3>
									<p>If you cannot answer all the questions and do not panic under any circumstances. Sometimes Interviewers ask hard questions.  It is OK! After I answered correctly one complexity question during the interview of a particular company, the Interviewer brought up some new research being done in the field and mocked me for not knowing enough. Sometimes they ask all sort of questions which are probably too hard for an under grad student. It is just to know if you are well prepared and have an interest beyond what is taught at your college.</p>

									<h3>Write about your projects on your CV</h3>
									<p>Write briefly and do not give it all away so that you can explain the interviewer later on during the actual interview  and impress him. If you are any good you can easily divert the whole interview process towards your projects and questions based on them. But do prepare in advance and read about your projects thoroughly. There is no excuse for failing to explain whatever you did during the time of the interview. I had 3 technical projects as well as 4-5 non technical ones including 2 Study Oriented Projects. I would focus on the technical ones during the coding profiles and the others during the rest.</p>

									<h3>Be to the point</h3>
									<p>Do not talk too much and and do not ramble on during interviews. Do not try to impress your Interviewers  by being quick to answer their questions and in the way not listening properly or giving a wrong answer. During my earlier interviews I used to guess a lot of answers, specially those complexity questions. I would say it is o(n2) and as an after thought o(log n). If you have some doubt just say that you are not completely sure of the answer but would still like to attempt the question and then follow up with the best logical explanation you can give even if you do not know if it is the exact answer.</p>

									<h3>Prepare different resumes for different profiles</h3>
									<p>The resume you make for a Business Analyst profile  will obviously have to be different for that coding profile. In case of Coding profiles put all your coding projects at the top and focus more on them during the interview while during interviews for Analyst / Account Manager / Others structure your resume in such a way that it suits the Job Description for the post. This was a mistake I made during a lot of Software Company interviews where I highlighted all my marketing based SOPs and internships instead of the technical projects. Do not make the same mistake.</p>

									<h3>If it is a telephonic interview fix the slot during which you can give your best</h3>
									<p>Most people in college only get up during the afternoon and are most proficient during late evenings. If possible try to arrange the interview according to that.</p>
